EXTRA Abstract

Dynamical models are a key tool for forecasting infectious-disease
outbreaks, and for evaluating the potential impacts of various
interventions. I will talk about the under-appreciated role of disease
generation times in disease modeling, and discuss applications to
Ebola, canine rabies and HIV.

Problem

	I am fundamentally a math person
	
		but I want to do work that is relevant to people

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution

	Dynamical modeling is fun and useful

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Dynamical modeling connects scales

REP DBFIG 0.7 my_images/trans.jpg 1 Disease_data/ewmeas.Rout.pdf

	Start with rules about how things change in short time steps

		Usually based on \emph{individuals}

	Calculate results over longer time periods

		Usually about \emph{populations}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fun and useful!

New problem

	There is (or was a gulf) between dynamical and statistical modeling

		Dynamics are needed to incorporate mechanism

		Statistics are needed to incorporate uncertainty

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Big \Rx

	$\Rx$ is the number of people who would be infected by an
	infectious individual \emph{in a fully susceptible population.}

	$\Rx = \beta/\gamma = \beta D = (cp) D$

		$c$: Contact Rate

		$p$: Probability of transmission (infectivity)

		$D$: Average duration of infection

	A disease can invade a population if and only if $\Rx>1$.

Exponential growth

	Diseases have a tendency to grow exponentially at first

		I infect three people, they each infect 3 people \ldots

		How fast does disease grow?

		How quickly do we need to respond?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

little $r$

	We measure epidemic \emph{speed} using little $r$:

		\emph{Units}: [1/time]

		Disease increases like $e^{rt}$

	Time scale is $C=1/r$

		Ebola, $C \approx 1 \mathrm{month}$

		HIV in SSA, $C \approx 18 \mathrm{month}$

RHEAD little $r$

FIG SIR_simulations/hiv_plot.Rout-4.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking assumptions

	Spatial homogeneity: everywhere is the same

	Individual homogeneity: everyone is the same

		and everyone is everywhere

	Temporal homogeneity

		It doesn't matter how long I've been infected, I'm either infected or not

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC The \rR\ relationship

	We're very interested in the relationship between little $r$ and \big \Rx.

	We might have better estimates of $r$

		e.g., West African Ebola outbreak, HIV in Africa

	Or we might have better estimates of \Rx.

		Measles, influenza

What happens if we account for burial transmission?

	We've made the disease transmitting process slower, so obviously Ebola is
	less dangerous than we thought

	We've added another source of transmission, so obviously Ebola is more
	dangerous than we thought

	What we learn depends on what we know!

TSS Generation intervals

BCC

	The generation distribution measures the time betweene generations of the
	disease

		Interval between ``index'' infection and resulting infection

	Generation intervals provide the link between \Rx\ and $r$

Conditional effect of generation time

	\emph{Given} the reproductive number $\Rx$

		faster generation time $G$ means higher $r$

		More danger

	\emph{Given} $r$

		faster generation time $G$ means \emph{smaller} \Rx

		Less danger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Linking framework

	Epidemic speed ($r$) is a \emph{product}:

		(something to do with) generation speed $\times$

		(something to do with) epidemic strength

	Epidemic strength (related to \Rx) is therefore q \emph{quotient}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Filtered means

	There is a sensible way to define an ``effective'' generation time 

	Preserve the exponential growth equation $${\Rx} = \exp(r \hat G)$$
		
	$\hat G$ is a ``filtered mean'' of the distribution $g$:

		$$\exp(-r\hat G) = \langle \exp(-r\tau) \rangle_g.$$,

	This is cool, but not easy to interpret (our estimates about the generation
	time change when $r$ changes)

Compound-interest interpretation

	Define $\Rx \approx (1 + r \kappa \bar G)^{1/\kappa} \equiv X(r \bar G; 1/\kappa)$

	$X$ is the compound-interest approximation to the exponential

		Linear when $\kappa=1$ (i.e., when $g$ is exponential)

		Approaches exponential as $\kappa \to 0$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Qualitative response

	For a given value of $\bar G$, smaller values of $\kappa$ mean:

		less variation in generation interval

		less compounding of growth

		greater \Rx\ required for a given $r$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fitting to Ebola

	Simulate generation intervals based on data and approach from
	WHO report

	Use both lognormals and gammas
	
		WHO used gammas

		Lognormals should be more challenging

Summary

	Generation intervals are the missing link between $r$ and \Rx

	We need better methods for estimating them, and propagating
	uncertainty to other parts of the model

	For many practical applications:

		Estimating the mean generation interval is not enough

		But estimating the mean and CV may be enough

		A good basis for understanding and propagating uncertainty

	Filtered mean remains intuitively useful

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Generation intervals through time

	Generation intervals can be estimated by:

		Observing patients:
		
			How long does it take to become infectious?
		
			How long does it take to recover?

			What is the time profile of infectiousness/activity?

		Contact tracing

			Who (probably) infected whom?

			When did each become infected?
			
				or ill (serial interval)?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Types of interval

	Contact-tracing intervals look systematically different, depending on when you observe them.

	Define:

		\emph{Intrinsic interval}: How infectious is a patient at time $\tau$
		after infection?

		\emph{Forward interval}: When will the people infected today 
		infect others?

		\emph{Backward interval}: When did the people who infected people today
		themselves become infected? 

		\emph{Censored interval}: What do all the intervals observed up until a
		particular time look like?

			Like backward intervals, if it's early in the epidemic

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Growing epidemics

BC

	Generation intervals look \emph{shorter} at the beginning of an epidemic

		A disproportionate number of people are infectious right now

		They haven't finished all of their transmitting

		We are biased towards observing faster events

Correcting

	Infection events: someone infected at time $s$ is infecting someone at time
	$t$

		$i_s(t) = S(t) k(t-s) i(s)$

	Backward intervals 

		Who infected the people infected at time $t$?
	
			$\propto k(t-s) i(s)$

		Depends on $k$, but also on changes in $i(s)$

	Forward intervals 

		Who did the people infected at time $s$ infect?
	
			$\propto S(t) k(t-s)$

		Depends on $k$, but also on changes in $S(t)$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What changes backward intervals?

	Who is likely to infect me depends on:

		How infectious they are (intrinsic GI)

		How many of them there are (changes in disease incidence)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What changes forward intervals?

	Who I am likely to infect depends on:

		How infectious I am (intrinsic GI)

		How many of them there are (changes in numbers of susceptibles)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

	Backward intervals change if the number of infectious individuals is
	changing as you look back

	Forward intervals change if the number of \emph{susceptible} individuals is
	changing as you look forward

	Lack of care in defining generation intervals can lead to bias

		In particular, censored intervals look too short, lead to underestimates
		of $\Rx$.
