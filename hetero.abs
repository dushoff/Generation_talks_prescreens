Generation intervals are an important and often-neglected component of the disease-transmission process. Mathematical models often assume exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, but the interval between when a focal individual was infected and when they infect others (and the distribution of such intervals) can play a crucial role in parameterizing models and in making inferences and forecasts.

I will outline some issues involved in estimating generation intervals in populations, from clinical data (infectious and incubation periods) and from contact-tracing data (who infected whom), and individual-level heterogeneity, and discuss how these effect disease forecasts and estimates of disease parameters.
